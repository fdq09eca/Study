    <p class="lead">This a mini-project. It builds a website that stores and reports data from a local SQLite datadase to the users. The goal of this project is getting myself familiar with the following technologies:</p>
        <ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal-md text-center">
          <li class='list-group-item flex-fill'>Flask</li>
          <li class='list-group-item flex-fill'>SQLAlchemy</li>
          <li class='list-group-item flex-fill'>Bootstrap</li>
          <li class='list-group-item flex-fill'>Jinja</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead font-weight-bold">
          Lesson I learned:
        </p>

         <ul>
           <li><span class='text-danger font-weight-bold'>TYPE CAREFULLY. </span>Otherwise you are spending 90% of time in finding bugs instead of being productive.</li>
           <li>Make sure you are using the <span class='text-danger font-weight-bold'>updated bootstrap version</span>, when you are using 3rd party autocomplete package</li>
           <li><span class='text-danger font-weight-bold'>READ CAREFULLY.</span> The documentation of bootstrap is complete and do not skip line when you read it.</li>
         </ul>
    <a href='https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-flask-bootcamp-create-websites-using-flask/learn/lecture/9346324#content'>Here</a> is the course for instruction, it is hard but rewarding, I learned a lot. Bootstrap is a very nice tool that saves me from typing hell lot of CSS like in Jekyll which demands a good understanding of the particular theme's CSS for making any adjustment.</p>
